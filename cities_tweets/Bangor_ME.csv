"Is it that he didn't specifically call out white progressives & WWC who gambled with our future with their protest or non votes while black women consistently come thru for the whole collective... ALWAYS? Or how they have the luxury to dilly dally with abstracts, ignoring reality"
"Hey, Huckabee do you think Maxine Waters should get AS? She gets death threats from you people all the damn time! But she doesn't talk about it! She just soldiers on. Yesterday a man was arrested for threatening her life in April."
