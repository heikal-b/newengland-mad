Atheism isn't a doctrine to follow nor is it sad or hopeless. Freedom from religion is actually liberating. The realization that subjugating yourself to a narcissistic father figure is not hopeful or loving. Especially when it's all just superstitious nonsense.

Right.
My main problem with the anti identity politics rhetoric is that all politics are identity politics. Your identity influences your views no matter what. When you are a minority you tend to value equality and justice. If these are bad things to you you're just plain evil.https://twitter.com/BlkAndPr0ud/status/1008198942880919552 …
