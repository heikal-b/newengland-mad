People like her don't think rants like that are hateful or disrespectful. She views immigrants as less than human.
"Holy cow @PanicAtTheDisco and @brendonurie, your new album is incredible."
"The nicest person in the administration is an immigrant who attacked the previous president publicly questioning his citizenship. She has mirrored her husband's opinions for years and continually backed him up. That doesn't make her nice,  it makes her complicit."

Atheism isn't a doctrine to follow nor is it sad or hopeless. Freedom from religion is actually liberating. The realization that subjugating yourself to a narcissistic father figure is not hopeful or loving. Especially when it's all just superstitious nonsense.
"It's not actually an insult so much as an opinion. If Christianity was a personal relationship with god, I probably wouldn't care. Unfortunately when your fellow Christians push their relationship into society and onto others they aren't loving and respectful."

My main problem with the anti identity politics rhetoric is that all politics are identity politics. Your identity influences your views no matter what. When you are a minority you tend to value equality and justice. If these are bad things to you you're just plain evil.https://twitter.com/BlkAndPr0ud/status/1008198942880919552 …

Private prison companies also line the pockets of judges and law enforcement. Kids are literally being sent to these places for minor infractions that normally don't even carry jail time. It's big business.
